# DotFiles
A repo to hold my DotFiles!

## Usage
Run the installer from the DotFiles directory and follow the prompts...

### First Run
If you don't already have the [onedark theme](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim) for vim installed you will see an error the first time you run the `vim_install.sh` script. It is safe to ignore this as the script installs it for you.

### Compatibility
Tested on macOS Sierra (10.12), and CentOS 7.2.

## Suggestions
I'm always looking for feedback and happy to hear your suggestions!
